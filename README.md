YoutubeDL-helper by William Haskell.

This script uses the tool youtube-dl from http://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/
I simply made a sort of simple front-end.

Usage:
- Requires installation of youtube-dl (see site above).
- (Optional) Add the script to your $PATH.
- ytdl [youtube playlist or video ID]

If no ID is given, it will prompt when the tool starts.

TODO:
- Add support for files containing a list of IDs.
- Clean up the code.

NOTE:
It is messy, I know!
